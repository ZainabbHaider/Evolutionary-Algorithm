# Introduction

This repository is showing the implementation of evolutionary algorithms for solving various optimization problems including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP), and for creating evolutionary art by recreating face images such as the Mona Lisa using polygons.

## Implementation

Evolutionary algorithms are population-based optimization techniques inspired by the principles of natural evolution. They are capable of finding solutions to complex problems by iteratively improving a population of candidate solutions over generations.

This repository provides implementations of evolutionary algorithms for solving:

- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: A classic problem in the field of combinatorial optimization where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

- **Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP)**: Another classic optimization problem concerned with scheduling a set of jobs on a set of machines, where each job consists of a sequence of operations that must be processed on specific machines subject to precedence constraints.

- **Evolutionary Art**: This involves creating art through the evolutionary process. In this repository, we focus on recreating face images, such as the Mona Lisa, using polygons. The goal is to evolve a population of polygons to resemble a target image.
